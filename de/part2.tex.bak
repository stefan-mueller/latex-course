\subsection{Graphiken}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Die \bftt{graphicx}-Erweiterung wird benötigt, da es den
\cmdbs{includegraphics}-Befehl beinhaltet.
\item Unterstützte Formate für Graphiken sind JPEG, PNG und PDF (normalerweise).
\end{itemize}
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\includegraphics[
  width=0.5\textwidth]{big_chick}

\includegraphics[
  width=0.3\textwidth,
  angle=270]{big_chick}
\end{exampletwouptiny}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exkurs: Optionale Befehle}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wir können eckige Klammern \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]} für optionale 
Befehle benutzen (anstelle von Klammern \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}).
\item \cmdbs{includegraphics} akzeptiert optionale Befehle, die es möglich machen, das Eigenschaften des Bildes zu ändern, nachdem es eingefügt wurde. Zum Beispiel skaliert \bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}} das Bild auf  30\% der Breite des umgebenden Texts (\cmdbs{textwidth}).
\item \cmdbs{documentclass} kann ebenfalls optionale Befehle nutzen Beispiel:
\mint{latex}|\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn]{article}|
\vskip 3ex
macht den Text größer (12pt)  und teilt ihn in zwei Spalten auf.
\item Wo findet man mehr Informationen? Schaue einfach in die Links am Ende dieser Präsentation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection[fragile]{Floats}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lass' \LaTeX{} entscheiden, wo es eine Abbildung platzieren soll.
\item Du kannst Abbildungen auch eine Bildunterschrift (caption) geben. Durch \cmdbs{ref} kannst Du dich im Text auf diese Abbildung beziehen.
\end{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\linewidth}
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single,resetmargins]{latex}%
  {media-graphics.tex}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\linewidth}

\end{minipage}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tabellen}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Es dauert etwas, um mit Tabellen in  \LaTeX{} zurecht zu kommen.
\item Nutze am besten die \bftt{tabular}-Umgebung der \bftt{tabularx}-Erweiterung.
\item Das Argument spezifiziert die Spaltenausrichtung --- \textbf{l}inks, \textbf{r}echts, \textbf{r}echts.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Gegenstand   & Häufigkeit & Preis in \$ \\
Gitarre & 1   & 199.99  \\
Lautsprecher & 2   & 399.99  \\
Kabel  & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item Nutze \cmdbs{hline} für horizontale Linien
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\\hline
Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item Nutze  das Und-Zeichen \keystrokebftt{\&}, um Spalten voneinander abzugrenzen, und einen Doppelten  to separate columns und einen doppelten umgekehrten Schrägstrich \keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs}, um eine neue Zeile zu beginnen (wie in der \bftt{align*}-Umgebung von Teil 1).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{bib\TeX}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Die Referenzen kommen in eine \bftt{.bib}-Datei im `bibtex'-Datenbank-Format:
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}
\item Die meisten Referenz-Management-Programme können ins bibtex-Format exportieren.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Jeder Eintrag in der \bftt{.bib}-Datei besitzt einen \emph{key}, den Du nutzt, um im Dokument diesen Eintrag zu zitieren.. Zum Beispiel ist \bftt{Jacobson1999Towards} der \emph{key} für:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
  author = {Van Jacobson},
  ...
}
\end{minted}
\item Es ist eine gute Idee, den key anhand von Name, Jahr und Titel zu erstellen.
\item \LaTeX{} kann automatisch in-text-Zitationen formatieren und erstellt ein Literaturverzeichnis am Ende des Dokuments; es gibt die gängigen Standard-Style, aber Du kannst auch eigene Änderungen vornehmen.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nutze die \bftt{natbib}-Erweiterung\footnote{Mit \bftt{biblatex} gibt es eine neuere Erweiterung mit mehr Eigenschaften.} und nutze \cmdbs{citet} und \cmdbs{citep}.
\item Schreibe \cmdbs{bibliography} ans Ende des Dokuments und bestimmen einen Zitierstil (\cmdbs{bibliographystyle}).
\end{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\linewidth}
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single,resetmargins]{latex}%
  {bib-example.tex}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\linewidth}

\subsection{Mehr nützliche Dinge}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Füge das Literaturverzeichnis mit dem \cmdbs{tableofcontents}-Befehl hinzu.

\item Ändere die Dokumentenklasse (\cmdbs{documentclass}) zu
\mint{latex}!\documentclass{scrartcl}!
oder
\mint{latex}!\documentclass[12pt]{IEEEtran}!

\item Definiere Deinen eigenen Befehl für eine komplizierte Gleichung:
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\newcommand{\rperf}{%
  \rho_{\text{perf}}}
$$
\rperf = {\bf c}'{\bf X} + \varepsilon
$$
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Weitere nützliche Erweiterungen}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{beamer}: für Präsentationen (so wie diese)
\item \bftt{todonotes}: Kommntare und To-Do-Notizen
\item \bftt{tikz}: Erstelle unglaubliche Grafiken
\item \bftt{pgfplots}: Erstelle Plots in \LaTeX
\item \bftt{listings}: Druckt den Quellcode inr \LaTeX
\item \bftt{spreadtab}: Erstelle Tabellenblätter \LaTeX
\item \bftt{cwpuzzle}: Kreuzworträtsel

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\LaTeX{} installieren}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item To run \LaTeX{} on your own computer, you'll want to use a \LaTeX{}
\emph{distribution}. A distribution includes a \bftt{latex} program
and (typically) several thousand packages.
\begin{itemize}
\item On Windows: \href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} or \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item On Linux: \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item On Mac: \href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX}
\end{itemize}
\item You'll also want a text editor with \LaTeX{} support. See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors} for a list of (many) options.
\item You'll also have to know more about how \bftt{latex} and its related tools
work --- see the resources on the next slide.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Online Resources}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{The \LaTeX{} Wikibook} ---
excellent tutorials and reference material.
\item \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/}{\TeX{} Stack Exchange} --- ask
questions and get excellent answers incredibly quickly
\item \href{http://www.latex-community.org/}{\LaTeX{} Community} --- a large
online forum
\item \href{http://ctan.org/}{Comprehensive \TeX{} Archive Network (CTAN)} ---
over four thousand packages plus documentation
\item Google will usually get you to one of the above.

% -- latex understands words, sentences and paragraphs

Words are separated by one or more spaces.  Paragraphs are separated by
one or more blank lines.  The output is not affected by adding extra
spaces or extra blank lines to the input file.

Double quotes are typed like this: ``quoted text''.
Single quotes are typed like this: `single-quoted text'.

Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
Bold       text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

-- Adding structure to your document

\section{Hello}

\subsection{World}

\subsection{Foo}

\subsubsection*{Stuff} % star form

\subsubsection*{Results}

-- Labels and cross-references

\label{sec:intro}
\label{sec:method}
\ref{sec:method}

--> maybe introduce the prettyref package here.

-- Mathematics

Inline mathematics: $x + y < 7$.

'Displayed' mathematics:
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\end{equation*}

\begin{align}
\end{align}

-- Figures

- Need the graphicx package.

- here we can start introducing options

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}

- where do you find out about these options? --> link to the Wikibook

-- Floating Figures

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{...}
\caption{\label{}Here is a caption.}
\end{figure}

-- Tables

- not the nicest part of LaTeX

\usepackage{tabularx}

\begin{tabular}{llr}
Item & Quantity & Price (\$) & Amount
Widget & 1 &
\end{tabular}

Bonus points: check out the fp package and the spreadtab package.

-- Document Classes

a .cls file

article

some journal templates come with one

-- Bibliographies



-- For Typesetting Geeks

- dashes: -, --, ---

- ellipsis.

- controlling spaces: ~, \ , \,, \@

- spacing after periods (et al., etc.)

- Nested quotation marks: ``\,`

\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{equation} and \bftt{equation*} are called \emph{environments}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \cmdbs{begin} and \cmdbs{end} commands define the environment.
  \item The \cmd{\$} also starts and ends an environment.
  \item Some commands are defined only within certain environments.
  \item Some commands behave differently in different environments.
